# A web Application to give user list 

# Technologies used: MERN Stack

To run the application we need both the backend (Node.js server with MongoDB) and the frontend (React application) are running. 
# Step 1: Start the Backend Server  :
             # node server.js

# Step 2: Start the Frontend React Application : 
             # npm start


Once both servers are running:

# Backend: 
Handles API requests (CRUD operations) to your MongoDB database. 
Make sure your backend APIs (http://localhost:5000/users/...) are correctly implemented and accessible.


# Frontend: 
Provides a user interface (UI) built with React, allowing users to interact with your application. 
Navigate through different routes (/, /add, /edit/:id) using the links or URL navigation.
